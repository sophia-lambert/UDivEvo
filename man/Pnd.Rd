\title{Probability density of node depths.}
\usage{
Pnd(t, r, epsi, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Numeric vector. A vector specifying the node depths of a phylogeny in millions of years.}

\item{r}{Numeric. The net diversification rate: \eqn{\lambda - \mu}. The units are in events/lineages/millions years.}

\item{epsi}{Numeric. The turnover rate: \eqn{\mu / \lambda}. The units are in events/lineages/millions years.}

\item{y}{Numeric. The sampling probability also called sampling fraction: \eqn{k / N}.}
}
\value{
The probability density of node depths equivalent to \eqn{f\_y(t)} in Lambert 2018 and to \eqn{\lambda * p1} in Stadler 2010 and Lambert et al. 2022.
}
\description{
Calculating the probability density of node depths of a phylogenetic tree.
