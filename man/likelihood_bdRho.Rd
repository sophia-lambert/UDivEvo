\arguments{
\item{tottime}{Numeric vector. The stem or crown age (also called MRCA) of the phylogenie(s) depending on the conditioning of the process specified and the phylogenie(s) used. The length of the numeric vector equals the number of phylogenie(s) used. It is of length 1 if a unique phylogeny is used. The stem age of the phylogeny can be computed using max(TreeSim::getx(phylo))+phylo$root.edge (note that the phylo$root.edge needs to be known) and the crown age of the phylogeny can be computed using max(TreeSim::getx(phylo)). If multiple phylogenies are used the following can be used for calculating the stem age: \code{sapply(seq_along(multiPhylo), function(i) max(TreeSim::getx(multiPhylo[[i]]))+multiPhylo[[i]]$root.edge)} and the crown age: \code{sapply(seq_along(multiPhylo), function(i) max(TreeSim::getx(multiPhylo[[i]])))}. Note that the phylogenies do not need to have the same root age but they need to be conditioned the same way (for all phylogenies either their stem or crown age).}

\item{nbtips}{Integer.  The number of extant sampled tips in the phylogeny typically noted \code{k}.}

\item{tj}{List of numeric vector(s). A list of atomic numeric vectors where each vector is specifying the node depths for each phylogeny. If only one phylogeny is used, the list is of length 1. The node depths of a phylogeny can be computed using \code{TreeSim::getx(phylo)[!TreeSim::getx(phylo)==tottime]} and using lapply(seq_along(multiPhylo), function(i) TreeSim::getx(multiPhylo[[i]])[!TreeSim::getx(multiPhylo[[i]])==tottime[i]]) for an object of class \code{multiPhylo}. This code works both for stem and crown phylogenies. Note that the \code{tottime} is not contained in node depths here since it is used for conditioning the process. Each numeric vector is of length \eqn{k-2} if the phylogeny is in crown and of length \eqn{k-1} if it is in stem with \code{k} being the number of extant sampled tips in the phylogeny since there are \eqn{k-1} internal nodes and in crown the MRCA is not included in the node depths since it is used for conditioning the process.}

\item{yj}{Numeric vector. The sampling probabilitie(s) typically calculated as \eqn{k/N} where \eqn{N} is the global diversity of the clade. The length of the numeric vector equals the number of phylogenie(s) used. If \code{NULL}, the sampling probabilitie(s) are integrated according to the specified sampling probability distribution.}

\item{reparam}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (the default option), the log likelihood is calculated using the parameters \eqn{r} and \eqn{\epsilon}. If \code{TRUE}, the log likelihood is parametrised using the product \eqn{y*\lambda} and the net diversification rate \eqn{r}.}

\item{beta}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} a beta distribution is assumed on the sampling probabilitie(s). Note that the parameters of the beta distribution can be fixed or inferred and can be specified in the function generated by the function \code{likelihood_bdRho} using the arguments \code{a} for the parameter \eqn{\alpha} and \code{b} for the parameter \eqn{\beta}.}

\item{unif}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} a uniform distribution is assumed on the sampling probabilitie(s). Note that the parameters of the uniform distribution can be fixed or inferred and can be specified in the function generated by the function \code{likelihood_bdRho} using the arguments \code{a} for the lower bound of the uniform distribution (\eqn{a\ge0}) and \code{b} for the higher bound of the uniform distribution (\eqn{b\le0} and \eqn{b\gea}).}

\item{root}{Integer. Specifying the conditioning of the birth-death process. Root takes the value \eqn{0} if the phylogeny used is a stem phylogeny and the process is conditioned on the stem age. It takes the value \eqn{1} if the phylogeny is a crown phylogeny and the process is conditioned on the crown age.}

\item{dt}{Numeric. This argument is only used if \code{yj = NULL} and \code{reparam = FALSE}. If \code{dt = 0}, the integral of the sampling probabilitie(s) is computed using the R \code{stats::integrate} function. If \eqn{dt\ge0}, the integral of the sampling probabilitie(s) is performed manually using a piece-wise constant approximation. \code{dt} represents the length of the interval on which the function integrated is assumed to be constant.}

\item{rel.tol}{Numeric. This argument is only used if \code{yj = NULL}, \code{reparam = FALSE} and \code{dt = 0}. This represents the relative accuracy requested when the integral is performed. Typically \code{.Machine$double.eps^0.25} is used but a value of \eqn{1e-10} has been tested and performs well.}

\item{tuned_dichotomy}{Logical. This argument is only used if \code{yj = NULL} and \code{reparam = FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, when the log likelihood is equal to non finite value due to approximations, a dichotomy search is performed to find a tuning parameter that will be used for getting a finite value of the log likelihood. If \code{TRUE}, the log likelihood will take longer to calculate.}

\item{brk}{Numeric. This argument is only used if \code{yj = NULL} and \code{reparam = FALSE}. The number of steps used in the dichotomy search. Typically the value \eqn{200} is sufficient to avoid non finite values. In some case, the value \eqn{2000} will be required for more tuning but it will rarely take a larger value.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{"function"}. This function can take the following arguments as described above depending on the chosen set up and will return the value of the log likelihood alone or in a list together with the tuning parameters values:
\describe{
  \item{div}{Numeric vector. The net diversification rate(s) also called \eqn{r}. The length of the numeric vector equals the number of phylogenie(s) used.}
  \item{turn}{Numeric vector. The turnover rate(s) also called \eqn{\epsilon}. The length of the numeric vector equals the number of phylogenie(s) used.}
  \item{ylamb}{Numeric vector. The product of the sampling probabilitie(s) and speciation rates \eqn{y*\lambda} also called \eqn{c} in Stadler 2009. The length of the numeric vector equals the number of phylogenie(s) used.}
  \item{tun.init}{Numeric vector. The initial tuning parameters values. Typically, it will take the value \eqn{\log 1}. The length of the numeric vector equals the number of phylogenie(s) used.}
  \item{seqphy.init}{Integer vector. A regular sequence of the number of phylogenie(s) used, i.e. if \eqn{10} phylogenies are used \code{seqphy.init = c(1:10)}}
  \item{a}{Numeric. The value of \eqn{\alpha} or \eqn{a} respectively for the beta or the uniform distribution. This value cannot be negative for both distributions and cannnot exceed \eqn{b} for the uniform distribution.}
  \item{b}{Numeric. The value of \eqn{\beta} or \eqn{b} respectively for the beta or the uniform distribution. This value cannot be negative for both distributions, cannnot be inferior to \eqn{a} and cannot exceed 1 for the uniform distribution.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the log likelihood of a rooted ultrametric phylogeny under a constant-time homogeneous birth-death model and Bernoulli sampling. The birth-death process is conditioned on the starting time of the process \code{tottime} and the survival of the process at present time. The log likelihood can be calculated specifying the sampling probability or integrating over it according to a specified sampling probability distribution (either uniform: \code{unif = TRUE} or beta distribution: \code{beta = TRUE}). This function can computes the log likelihood on a stem or crown phylogeny or a set of phylogenies assuming common or specific diversification rates. It is by default parametrised on the net diversification rate and the turnover rate but can be reparametrised on the product \eqn{y*\lambda} and the net diversification rate \eqn{r}.

\details{
This function is a closure, it takes all of the above as arguments and creates another function with arguments depending on the birth-death model chosen. If a unique phylogeny is used and the corresponding sampling probability is given in \code{yj}, then the classical birth-death-sampling model is used and the function created takes \code{div}: the net diversification rate and \code{turn}: the turnover rate as arguments. If a unique phylogeny is used, \code{yj = NULL} and the log likelihood is set for being reparametrised \code{reparam = TRUE}, then the reparametrised birth-death-sampling model is used and the function created takes \code{div}: the net diversification rate and \code{ylamb}: the product of the sampling probability and speciation rate \eqn{y*\lambda} as arguments. If a unique phylogeny is used, \code{yj = NULL} and \code{reparam = FALSE}, then the \eqn{birth-death\_{âˆ«\rho}} model is used and the function created takes \code{tun.init}: the initial tuning parameters values and \code{seqphy.init}: the phylogenies number for which to use the corresponding tuning parameter. This former function creates another function that takes as argument \code{div}: the net diversification rate, \code{turn}: the turnover rate, \code{a}: the first argument of the sampling probabilitie(s) distribution chosen (see \code{\link{phi}} for more details) and \code{b}: the second argument of the sampling probabilitie(s) distribution chosen (see \code{\link{phi}} for more details). If a set of phylogenies are used for computing the log likelihood then all the parameters except the one relatives to the hyperparameters of the sampling probabilitie(s) distribution described in this section: \code{div}, \code{turn}, \code{ylamb}, \code{tun.init} and \code{seqphy.init} have to be of length the number of phylogenies used. Note that this function is not able to evaluate negative rates. This function is specifically intended to be used on phylogenies with unknown or highly uncertain global diversity estimates. We thus do not know the sampling probability with accuracy. Note that the sampling probability is never estimated.
